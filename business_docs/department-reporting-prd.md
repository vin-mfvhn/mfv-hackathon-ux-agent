# Department-Level Reporting & Cost Center Allocation Views - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable finance directors to track and allocate lease costs across departments with precision
- Provide department managers with visibility into their lease footprint and associated costs
- Automate cost center allocation using multiple methodologies (headcount, square footage, revenue)
- Deliver interactive dashboards for real-time lease cost analysis and budget variance monitoring
- Support strategic space planning decisions through utilization analytics and scenario modeling

### Background Context

The Money Forward Lease Accounting system currently manages lease contracts, payment schedules, and compliance calculations effectively. However, enterprise customers consistently request enhanced visibility into how lease costs impact different organizational units. Finance teams struggle with manual cost allocation processes, spending 40+ hours monthly creating department-level reports in Excel. Department managers lack visibility into their space utilization and lease expenses, leading to suboptimal space planning decisions.

This feature addresses the critical gap between lease contract management and operational cost transparency. By implementing automated cost allocation and interactive reporting capabilities, we enable data-driven decision making for space optimization, budget planning, and lease negotiations. The feature leverages existing contract and department data while adding sophisticated allocation algorithms and user-friendly dashboards.

2. Dashboard shows $2.4M total spend, 5.2% over budget (red alert)
3. She clicks on Sales department (highest variance at +8.0%)
4. Drill-down shows NYC office is the issue - $48K/month vs $42K budgeted
5. She notices utilization is only 78% - underused space
6. She runs scenario: "What if we reduce NYC by 20%?"
7. System shows $244K annual savings, 4.2 month payback
8. She exports executive summary and scenario analysis for board meeting

### Scenario 2: Department Manager Budget Planning (Mike - Engineering)
**Context:** Preparing Q1 2025 departmental budget, needs accurate lease forecasts

**User Journey:**
1. Mike accesses his department portal in November
2. Views current lease allocation: $26K/month across 3 locations
3. Sees NYC lease expires in 14 months - needs renewal decision
4. Reviews team growth projections: +15 headcount in Q1
5. Models space needs: Current 82% utilization + 15 people = need expansion
6. Requests space increase through system workflow
7. Finance gets notification with business justification
8. Mike receives approval/denial with cost implications

### Scenario 3: Real Estate Manager Space Optimization (Lisa)
**Context:** Company mandate to reduce real estate footprint by 15% across all locations

**User Journey:**
1. Lisa runs portfolio analysis across all 25 locations
2. Identifies 8 locations with <70% utilization (underperforming)
3. Models consolidation scenarios combining nearby offices
4. Calculates impact: $1.2M annual savings, affects 340 employees across 4 departments
5. Presents recommendations to department heads for feedback
6. Models employee satisfaction impact and commute changes
7. Creates implementation timeline with lease expiration coordination
8. Tracks progress against savings targets monthly

### Scenario 4: Accountant Month-End Close (Jennifer)
**Context:** Monthly close process, needs accurate department cost allocations for financial statements
