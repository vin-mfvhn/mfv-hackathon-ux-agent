# Trade Partner Management Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable efficient management of business trade relationships through a comprehensive partner information system
- Provide secure, role-based access control for trade partner data management with real-time LA system integration
- Streamline data operations with robust import/export capabilities and comprehensive error handling
- Ensure consistent user experience through permission-driven UI controls and validation workflows
- Deliver cost-effective partner management solution that avoids over-engineering of enterprise platforms

### Background Context

The Trade Partner Management feature addresses the critical need for systematic handling of business relationships within organizations currently managing partner information through fragmented systems, spreadsheets, or legacy applications. This centralized solution eliminates data inconsistencies, security gaps, and operational inefficiencies by providing a purpose-built system that integrates seamlessly with the existing LA (License Administrator) system for enterprise-grade permission control.

Unlike complex CRM or ERP solutions that require extensive customization and training, this system focuses specifically on trade partner data management with a simplified three-field model while maintaining sophisticated security and import/export capabilities essential for enterprise operations.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The system shall provide full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for trade partner records with three core fields: Trade Partner Code, Trade Partner Name, and Setting Display (0 or 1).

**FR2**: The system shall enforce mandatory field validation before saving any trade partner record, including format validation, length limits, and business rule compliance.

**FR3**: The system shall dynamically enable/disable UI buttons and controls based on the user's current permission level from the LA system.

**FR4**: The system shall support file import functionality with comprehensive validation including file size limits (maximum 10MB), file format validation, and content structure verification.

**FR5**: The system shall provide detailed error handling for import operations, including pre-import file validation (empty files, header-only files) and post-import field validation (character limits, format requirements).

**FR6**: The system shall allow users to stop import operations in progress, with backend support determining whether the stop action is immediately effective or requires completion.

**F7**: The system shall display appropriate error modals and toast notifications for failed import operations, with 'X' close functionality showing detailed error information.

**FR8**: The system shall provide export functionality supporting both complete dataset exports and filtered search result exports.

**FR9**: The system shall validate Trade Partner Code field with maximum 20 character limit and enforce uniqueness constraints.

**FR10**: The system shall validate Trade Partner Name field with appropriate length limits and character restrictions.

**FR11**: The system shall validate Setting Display field to accept only binary values (0 or 1) with clear user interface indicators.

**FR12**: The system shall provide search and filter capabilities for trade partner records with export of filtered results.

**FR13**: The system shall maintain data consistency and prevent duplicate Trade Partner Code entries across all operations.

**FR14**: The system shall provide user-friendly error messages and guidance for all validation failures and operational errors.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime with real-time permission synchronization remaining active and responsive.

**NFR2**: The system shall support concurrent access for multiple users with response times under 2 seconds for standard CRUD operations.

**NFR3**: The system shall handle datasets of 10,000+ trade partner records with sub-second query response times and efficient pagination.

**NFR4**: The system shall complete LA system permission synchronization within 5 seconds of any permission changes.

**NFR5**: The system shall process file imports up to 10MB with comprehensive error reporting and user progress indicators.

**NFR6**: The system shall complete full dataset exports within 30 seconds regardless of dataset size up to system limits.

**NFR7**: The system shall maintain enterprise-grade security standards with all data transmission encrypted and access properly authenticated through LA system integration.

**NFR8**: The system shall provide intuitive user interface with minimal training requirements, achieving 4.5/5 user satisfaction scores for usability and efficiency.

## Technical Assumptions

### Integration Requirements
- **LA System Integration**: Real-time API connectivity with the License Administrator system for permission management
- **Authentication**: Seamless integration with existing organizational authentication infrastructure
- **Data Security**: All trade partner data must be encrypted in transit and at rest

### Performance Requirements
- **Scalability**: System must support growth to 50,000+ trade partner records
- **Concurrent Users**: Support for 100+ simultaneous users without performance degradation  
- **Import Processing**: Efficient bulk data processing with progress tracking and error recovery

### User Interface Requirements
- **Responsive Design**: Compatible with desktop and tablet devices
- **Browser Support**: Support for modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Accessibility**: Basic accessibility compliance for enterprise users

## Next Steps

### Implementation Priorities
1. **Foundation Development**: Core CRUD operations with three-field data model
2. **Import/Export System**: Comprehensive file processing with error handling
3. **User Interface**: Permission-driven interface with dynamic controls
4. **Testing & Validation**: Comprehensive testing of all permission scenarios and error conditions

This PRD provides the complete technical and functional foundation for implementing the Trade Partner Management feature according to specifications and competitive requirements identified in the project brief and market analysis.
