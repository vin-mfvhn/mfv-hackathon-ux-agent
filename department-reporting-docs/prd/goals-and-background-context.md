# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable finance directors to track and allocate lease costs across departments with precision
- Provide department managers with visibility into their lease footprint and associated costs
- Automate cost center allocation using multiple methodologies (headcount, square footage, revenue)
- Deliver interactive dashboards for real-time lease cost analysis and budget variance monitoring
- Support strategic space planning decisions through utilization analytics and scenario modeling

## Background Context

The Money Forward Lease Accounting system currently manages lease contracts, payment schedules, and compliance calculations effectively. However, enterprise customers consistently request enhanced visibility into how lease costs impact different organizational units. Finance teams struggle with manual cost allocation processes, spending 40+ hours monthly creating department-level reports in Excel. Department managers lack visibility into their space utilization and lease expenses, leading to suboptimal space planning decisions.

This feature addresses the critical gap between lease contract management and operational cost transparency. By implementing automated cost allocation and interactive reporting capabilities, we enable data-driven decision making for space optimization, budget planning, and lease negotiations. The feature leverages existing contract and department data while adding sophisticated allocation algorithms and user-friendly dashboards.
