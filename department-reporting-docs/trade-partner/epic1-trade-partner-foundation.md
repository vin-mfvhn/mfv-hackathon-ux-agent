# Epic 1: Trade Partner Foundation & Core CRUD Operations

## Epic Goal

Establish the foundational data model and core CRUD functionality for Trade Partner Management, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete trade partner records with proper validation and data integrity controls.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context
- **Current State**: Organizations manage trade partner information through fragmented systems, spreadsheets, or legacy applications
- **Technology Stack**: Web-based enterprise application with database backend
- **Integration Points**: Preparation for LA system integration (implemented in Epic 2)

### Enhancement Details
- **What's being added**: Complete Trade Partner data management foundation with three-field model (Trade Partner Code, Trade Partner Name, Setting Display)
- **How it integrates**: New module within existing enterprise application framework
- **Success criteria**: Users can efficiently manage partner records with data validation and consistency

## Stories

### 1. **Story 1.1**: Create Trade Partner Data Model and Database Schema
Create the foundational database structure for trade partner records with proper constraints and indexes.

### 2. **Story 1.2**: Implement Trade Partner CRUD API Endpoints  
Develop backend API endpoints for Create, Read, Update, Delete operations with comprehensive validation.

### 3. **Story 1.3**: Build Basic Trade Partner Management UI
Create user interface for trade partner management with form validation and data display capabilities.

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ New database tables follow existing naming conventions
- ✅ API endpoints follow established REST patterns  
- ✅ UI components use existing design system and patterns
- ✅ No impact on existing application performance

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Data model changes affecting future integration requirements
- **Mitigation**: Design extensible schema with LA integration requirements in mind
- **Rollback Plan**: Database migration scripts with rollback procedures and feature flags for UI components

## Definition of Done

- ✅ Trade Partner database schema created with proper constraints
- ✅ All CRUD API endpoints functional with validation
- ✅ Basic UI allows full partner record management
- ✅ Field validation enforced (Code max 20 chars, unique constraints, Setting Display 0/1)
- ✅ Unit tests cover all CRUD operations
- ✅ API documentation updated
- ✅ No regression in existing application functionality

## Acceptance Criteria Summary

### Data Model
- Trade Partner Code: VARCHAR(20), unique, required
- Trade Partner Name: VARCHAR(255), required  
- Setting Display: TINYINT(1), required, values 0 or 1
- Standard audit fields (created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by)

### API Functionality
- POST /api/trade-partners (Create)
- GET /api/trade-partners (Read all with pagination)
- GET /api/trade-partners/{id} (Read single)
- PUT /api/trade-partners/{id} (Update)
- DELETE /api/trade-partners/{id} (Delete)

### UI Functionality  
- Trade Partner list view with search/filter
- Add new partner form with validation
- Edit existing partner functionality
- Delete partner with confirmation
- Basic error handling and user feedback

## Next Epic Dependency

Epic 2 (LA Integration & Permission System) depends on this epic's completion to layer permission controls over the core CRUD functionality.
