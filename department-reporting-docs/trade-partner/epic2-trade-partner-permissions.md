# Epic 2: Trade Partner LA Integration & Permission System

## Epic Goal

Implement real-time integration with the LA (License Administrator) system to provide four-tier permission control over Trade Partner functionality, ensuring enterprise-grade security and dynamic UI behavior based on user access levels.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context
- **Current State**: Epic 1 provides basic CRUD functionality without access controls
- **Technology Stack**: Web-based enterprise application with LA system integration capability
- **Integration Points**: LA system API for real-time permission synchronization

### Enhancement Details
- **What's being added**: Four-tier permission system (None/Hidden, Read+Export, Read+Create/Edit+Import, Full Access) with real-time LA integration
- **How it integrates**: Real-time API calls to LA system with UI state management for dynamic controls
- **Success criteria**: Users see appropriate functionality based on LA permissions with 5-second sync time

## Stories

### 1. **Story 2.1**: Implement LA System Integration API
Create secure API integration layer for real-time permission retrieval from LA system.

### 2. **Story 2.2**: Build Permission Management Service
Develop service layer to manage four-tier permission logic and caching for performance.

### 3. **Story 2.3**: Implement Dynamic UI Permission Controls
Update UI components to dynamically enable/disable functionality based on user permissions.

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ LA system API integration follows existing authentication patterns
- ✅ Permission caching doesn't affect existing session management
- ✅ UI permission changes maintain existing component structure
- ✅ Real-time updates don't impact application performance

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: LA system downtime affecting Trade Partner functionality
- **Mitigation**: Implement permission caching and graceful degradation
- **Rollback Plan**: Feature flags to disable LA integration and revert to basic functionality

## Definition of Done

- ✅ LA system API integration functional with proper error handling
- ✅ Four-tier permission system enforced across all endpoints
- ✅ UI dynamically shows/hides controls based on permissions
- ✅ Permission changes reflected within 5 seconds
- ✅ Menu hidden for users with "None" permission
- ✅ Export functionality available for "Read+Export" level
- ✅ Import functionality available for "Read+Create/Edit+Import" level
- ✅ Delete functionality only available for "Full Access" level
- ✅ Performance impact minimal (<100ms per permission check)
- ✅ Comprehensive testing of all permission scenarios

## Permission Matrix Implementation

### Permission Level 1: None
- **Access**: Menu completely hidden
- **Functionality**: No access to Trade Partner module

### Permission Level 2: Read + Export
- **Access**: View trade partner records, export functionality
- **UI Controls**: Search, filter, view details, export button enabled

### Permission Level 3: Read + Create/Edit + Import  
- **Access**: All Read+Export plus create, edit, and import capabilities
- **UI Controls**: Add, edit, import buttons enabled (delete disabled)

### Permission Level 4: Full Access
- **Access**: All functionality including delete operations
- **UI Controls**: All buttons and controls enabled

## LA System Integration Specifications

### Real-time Permission Sync
- API endpoint: `GET /la/api/user-permissions/{userId}/trade-partner`
- Response time SLA: <5 seconds
- Caching strategy: 5-minute cache with real-time invalidation
- Error handling: Graceful degradation to cached permissions

### Security Requirements
- All LA API calls use existing enterprise authentication
- Permission data encrypted in transit
- No sensitive permission data stored permanently
- Audit logging for all permission-based access attempts

## Next Epic Dependency

Epic 3 (Import/Export System) depends on this epic's permission controls to properly restrict import/export functionality based on user access levels.
