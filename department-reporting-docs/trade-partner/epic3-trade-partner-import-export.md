# Epic 3: Trade Partner Import/Export System with Error Handling

## Epic Goal

Implement comprehensive file import/export functionality with sophisticated error handling, validation, and user control features, enabling efficient bulk operations while maintaining data integrity and providing excellent user experience.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context
- **Current State**: Epic 1 provides CRUD operations, Epic 2 provides permission controls
- **Technology Stack**: Web-based application with file processing capabilities
- **Integration Points**: Permission system from Epic 2 controls import/export access

### Enhancement Details
- **What's being added**: Full import/export system with comprehensive validation, error handling, and user-controlled operations
- **How it integrates**: Builds on existing CRUD API and permission system
- **Success criteria**: Users can efficiently manage bulk partner data with clear error guidance and recovery options

## Stories

### 1. **Story 3.1**: Implement File Import System with Validation
Create file upload and processing system with comprehensive pre-import and post-import validation.

### 2. **Story 3.2**: Build Advanced Error Handling and User Controls
Develop sophisticated error reporting, user-controlled stop functionality, and error recovery workflows.

### 3. **Story 3.3**: Implement Export System with Filtering Options
Create export functionality supporting both complete datasets and filtered result exports.

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ File processing doesn't impact existing application performance
- ✅ Import/export respects existing permission system from Epic 2
- ✅ Error handling follows existing application patterns
- ✅ Bulk operations maintain existing data validation rules

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Large file imports affecting system performance
- **Mitigation**: Asynchronous processing with progress tracking and resource limits
- **Rollback Plan**: Transaction rollback for failed imports and feature flags for import/export functionality

## Definition of Done

- ✅ File import supports standard formats (CSV, Excel) up to 10MB
- ✅ Pre-import validation catches file errors (size, format, empty, header-only)
- ✅ Post-import validation enforces field constraints (code length, uniqueness)
- ✅ User-controlled stop functionality during import operations
- ✅ Comprehensive error modals and toast notifications
- ✅ Export supports both complete dataset and filtered results
- ✅ Progress indicators for long-running operations
- ✅ Import/export respects permission levels from Epic 2
- ✅ Performance testing shows minimal impact on system resources
- ✅ Error recovery workflows tested and documented

## Import System Specifications

### File Validation (Pre-import)
- **File Size**: Maximum 10MB limit with clear error messaging
- **File Format**: Support CSV and Excel (.xlsx) formats
- **Content Validation**: Detect empty files and header-only files
- **Structure Validation**: Verify required columns and data format

### Data Validation (Post-import)
- **Trade Partner Code**: Max 20 characters, uniqueness validation
- **Trade Partner Name**: Required field validation, character limits
- **Setting Display**: Binary validation (0 or 1 only)
- **Duplicate Handling**: Clear conflict resolution options

### User Control Features
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time import progress with estimated completion
- **Stop Functionality**: User-controlled import termination (backend-dependent)
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed error logs with line numbers and correction guidance
- **Recovery Options**: Partial import success handling and retry mechanisms

## Export System Specifications

### Export Options
- **Complete Dataset**: Export all trade partner records with format options
- **Filtered Results**: Export based on current search/filter criteria
- **Format Support**: CSV and Excel export formats
- **Performance**: Complete exports (up to 10MB) within 30 seconds

### Permission Integration
- **Read+Export Level**: Can export viewed data only
- **Higher Permissions**: Can export all data regardless of view restrictions
- **Audit Logging**: Track all export operations for compliance

## Error Handling Specifications

### Error Categories
1. **File Errors**: Size limits, format issues, corruption
2. **Content Errors**: Missing headers, invalid data formats
3. **Validation Errors**: Field constraints, business rules
4. **System Errors**: Processing failures, timeout issues

### User Experience
- **Toast Notifications**: Non-blocking status updates during processing
- **Error Modals**: Detailed error information with 'X' close functionality
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback for long operations
- **Recovery Guidance**: Clear next steps for error resolution

## Performance Requirements

- **File Processing**: Handle 10,000+ records efficiently
- **Memory Management**: Prevent memory overflow on large files
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking UI during import/export
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable processing limits to protect system

## Next Epic Dependency

Epic 4 (UI/UX Enhancement) will build upon this system to provide polished user experience and advanced workflow optimizations.
