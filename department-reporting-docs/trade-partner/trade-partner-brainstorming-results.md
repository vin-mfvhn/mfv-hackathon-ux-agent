## Technique 1: What If Scenarios

### Starting Question:
**What if your Trade Partner system could predict future partner relationship changes before they happen?**

Think about this scenario - imagine your system had predictive capabilities. What opportunities would this create? What would users do differently? What new problems might it solve?

## Technique 2: Analogical Thinking

### Core Analogy:
**Think of your Trade Partner system like a "Digital Rolodex" - but for the modern enterprise.**

Just like the classic Rolodex was simple, organized, and instantly accessible, your system provides clean partner management. But what if we looked at other analogies?

**Your turn:** Think of 2-3 other analogies for what your Trade Partner system could be like:
- A library catalog system?
- A high-security vault?
- A traffic control system?
- Something completely different?

What parallels do you see? What features or capabilities might each analogy suggest?

## Technique 3: Forced Relationships (Random Selection)

### Unexpected Connection:
**What if you combined your Trade Partner system with... a Weather Forecast App?**

At first glance, these seem completely unrelated! But let's find the bridge:

**Weather Apps provide:**
- Real-time conditions and alerts
- Predictive forecasting (7-day outlook)
- Location-based customization
- Simple visual indicators (sunny/cloudy/stormy)
- Historical data patterns
- User-friendly dashboards

**Forced Connection Ideas:**
- **Partner Weather Dashboard**: Show "business climate" for each partner (healthy/warning/storm)
- **Relationship Forecasting**: 30/60/90 day partner relationship outlook
- **Alert System**: Like weather warnings, but for partner issues/opportunities  
- **Historical Patterns**: Track seasonal partner activity trends

What other connections can you see between weather forecasting and partner management? What features might this unexpected combination inspire?
