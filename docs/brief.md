# Project Brief: BMAD Agent Development

## Executive Summary

This project focuses on developing two specialized agents for the BMAD system to accelerate Product Manager and Product Owner prototype creation. The **MFUI UX Expert Agent** will provide deep knowledge of MFUI React UI components and MoneyForward design patterns, while the **Product Builder Agent** will generate template-based prototypes directly from requirements. These agents address the critical bottleneck of designer dependency in rapid prototyping, enabling PdMs and POs to validate concepts quickly using proven LA Frontend patterns and the comprehensive MFUI component library.

**Key Value Proposition:** Transform the prototype creation process from weeks to hours by leveraging systematized design knowledge and automated template generation.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

Product Managers and Product Owners at MoneyForward face significant bottlenecks in prototype creation:

- **Designer Dependency Bottleneck**: PdMs cannot create UI prototypes without designer availability, slowing validation cycles
- **Component Selection Confusion**: PdMs know WHAT they want but struggle with HOW to structure it using available MFUI components  
- **Template Selection Challenges**: Non-technical stakeholders struggle to choose appropriate templates and patterns
- **Knowledge Fragmentation**: MFUI component knowledge and LA Frontend patterns exist but aren't systematically accessible

### Impact of the Problem

- **Slow Validation Cycles**: Weeks required for simple prototype creation instead of hours
- **Resource Inefficiency**: Designer time consumed on early-stage prototypes rather than refined designs
- **Inconsistent Outputs**: Ad-hoc approaches lead to varied quality and MoneyForward design system compliance
- **Reduced Innovation Speed**: Ideas stall waiting for technical implementation support

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Current approaches lack systematic knowledge curation and automated template generation. Generic UI tools don't understand MoneyForward's specific design system and patterns. Manual processes don't scale with increasing prototype demands.

### Urgency and Importance

Rapid prototype creation is essential for competitive product development. The existing knowledge base (49+ MFUI components, proven LA Frontend patterns) provides a foundation that can be systematized immediately for significant productivity gains.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept and Approach

Develop two complementary AI agents that systematize MoneyForward's existing design knowledge:

1. **MFUI UX Expert Agent**: Deep expertise in MFUI components, design tokens, and usage patterns
2. **Product Builder Agent**: Template-based prototype generation from requirements using proven patterns

### Key Differentiators

- **MoneyForward-Specific**: Built on actual MFUI components and LA Frontend patterns rather than generic UI knowledge
- **Template-Driven**: Systematic approach using categorized templates (List Pages, CRUD Forms, Detail Pages, Dashboard Pages, SidePane Workflows)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Leverages real-world usage patterns from successful LA Frontend implementations
- **Speed-Optimized**: Designed for rapid iteration and validation rather than perfection

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

- **Foundation Exists**: MFUI component library and LA Frontend patterns provide proven knowledge base
- **Clear User Need**: Brainstorming revealed specific, validated pain points
- **Systematic Approach**: Template categorization enables consistent, predictable outputs
- **Iterative Design**: Focus on speed enables rapid validation and improvement cycles
