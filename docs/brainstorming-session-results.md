**Session Date:** 2025-01-14
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** Product Team

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Build new agents for BMAD system

**Session Goals:** Design two specialized BMAD agents:
- MFUI UX Expert Agent with MFUI React UI Library knowledge  
- Product Builder Agent that builds products from requirements using templates

**Techniques Used:** Role Playing, Morphological Analysis, First Principles Thinking

**Total Ideas Generated:** 25+ specific ideas across agent design, knowledge bases, and implementation approaches

### Key Themes Identified:
- Accelerate PdM/PO prototype creation without designer dependency
- Leverage existing LA Frontend patterns for consistency
- Systematize MFUI component knowledge for better selection
- Create template-based workflows for rapid prototyping
- Maintain MoneyForward design system compliance

## Technique Sessions

### Role Playing Technique - 25 minutes

**Description:** Explored agent requirements from different stakeholder perspectives (developers, PMs, POs) to uncover needs and pain points.

#### Ideas Generated:
1. MFUI components/API/design-tokens knowledge essential for agent
2. Solve rapid prototyping without designer dependency bottleneck
3. Agent must understand stories, epics, PRD, project briefs as input
4. PdMs struggle with User Journey → UI Flow translation
5. PdMs need help with User Needs → Component Selection mapping
6. Product Builder should generate template-based feature prototypes
7. Smart template/component selection guidance needed
8. Focus on PdM/PO use case for internal prototyping (not end-user interfaces)

#### Insights Discovered:
- PdMs know WHAT they want but struggle with HOW to structure it using available components
- Template selection is a major pain point for non-technical stakeholders
- Rapid validation through prototypes is more valuable than perfect UI

#### Notable Connections:
- Developer knowledge needs align with PdM selection challenges
- Template-based approach bridges technical and business requirements
- Both agents serve the same core purpose from different angles

### Morphological Analysis - 30 minutes

**Description:** Systematically analyzed agent components including knowledge bases, commands, inputs, outputs, and template categories.

#### Ideas Generated:
1. MFUI UX Expert needs 4 key knowledge areas: Component Library (49+ components), Design Tokens, Architecture Patterns, MFUI Guidelines
2. Use CSS Modules instead of PandaCSS to reduce complexity
3. Keep existing commands: create-front-end-spec, generate-ui-prompt
4. Product Builder Agent should handle both specifications AND code implementation
5. Workflow: Stories → Front-end specs → Code implementation
6. Template Categories: List Pages, CRUD Forms, Detail Pages, Dashboard Pages, SidePane Workflows
7. LA Frontend provides real-world MFUI usage patterns
8. 5 key UI patterns identified: List Page, CRUD Form, DataGrid Table, SidePane, Common Component Usage
9. Agent knowledge should include proven patterns from LA Frontend codebase

#### Insights Discovered:
- Real-world usage patterns from LA Frontend are more valuable than theoretical component knowledge
- Template categorization enables systematic prototype generation
- Both agents need different but complementary knowledge bases

#### Notable Connections:
- LA Frontend patterns directly map to template categories
- MFUI component knowledge enhances template selection accuracy
- Specification-first approach enables better code generation

### First Principles Thinking - 15 minutes

**Description:** Identified fundamental principles and core purpose driving effective specialized agent design.

#### Ideas Generated:
1. Core Purpose: "Accelerate PdM/PO prototype creation"
2. MFUI UX Expert Principles: Choose semantic components, prioritize task completion, maintain MoneyForward consistency
3. Product Builder Principles: Speed over perfection, pattern reuse, requirements mapping
4. Essential agent qualities: Domain expertise, workflow integration, pattern recognition
5. Success metrics: Prototype creation speed, design consistency, requirement traceability

#### Insights Discovered:
- Single clear purpose enables focused agent design
- Principles guide decision-making in ambiguous situations
- Speed is more valuable than perfection for prototype creation

#### Notable Connections:
- All principles align with core purpose of acceleration
- Agent effectiveness depends on knowledge quality, not just quantity
- User-centric design principles apply to agent design itself
