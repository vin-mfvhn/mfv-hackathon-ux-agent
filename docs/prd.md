# BMAD Agent Development Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Reduce prototype creation time from weeks to hours (target: 90% time reduction)
- Enable 80% of prototypes to be created without designer dependency  
- Achieve 95% MoneyForward design system compliance in generated prototypes
- Accelerate overall feature development cycle time by 30%
- Transform PdM/PO workflow efficiency through systematic MFUI knowledge automation
- Create reusable template system covering 80% of common prototype use cases

### Background Context
MoneyForward Product Managers and Product Owners currently face significant bottlenecks in prototype creation due to designer dependency, component selection confusion, and fragmented knowledge of MFUI patterns. Despite having 49+ MFUI components and proven LA Frontend patterns, this knowledge isn't systematically accessible for rapid prototyping. 

This PRD addresses the critical need to systematize existing MoneyForward design knowledge through two specialized BMAD agents: the MFUI UX Expert Agent (providing deep MFUI component expertise) and the Product Builder Agent (generating template-based prototypes). The solution leverages established LA Frontend patterns rather than creating new approaches, focusing on speed-enabling iteration over perfection.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Clean, professional interface consistent with MoneyForward design language that empowers non-technical users to create technical specifications confidently. Focus on guided workflows that reduce cognitive load while maintaining flexibility for power users.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language input for requirements with structured output
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
- **Template-First Approach**: Present template options before custom generation
- **Component Recommendation Engine**: Interactive component selection with visual previews and rationale

### Core Screens and Views
- Agent Selection Dashboard (choose MFUI UX Expert vs Product Builder)
- Component Explorer (searchable MFUI component library with usage examples)
- Template Gallery (categorized templates with preview and selection)
- Requirements Input Form (structured input for user stories and specifications)
- Generated Prototype Preview (code output with compliance validation results)
- Project Management Interface (save, version, and share generated prototypes)

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Ensure compatibility with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and MoneyForward accessibility standards for internal tool compliance.

### Branding
Consistent with MoneyForward design system including color palette, typography, and component styling. Professional, trustworthy appearance that reinforces confidence in generated outputs.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primarily desktop-focused for PdM/PO workflow but responsive design for tablet use during meetings and collaborative sessions.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Leverage existing BMAD system monorepo structure for consistency and simplified dependency management across agents.

### Service Architecture
Agent-based microservices architecture within BMAD framework. Each agent (MFUI UX Expert, Product Builder) operates as independent service with shared knowledge base and template engine components.

### Testing Requirements
Unit testing for component recommendation logic, integration testing for template generation, manual testing convenience methods for PdM/PO workflow validation. Focus on accuracy of generated outputs and compliance validation.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Access to MFUI repository for real-time component data synchronization
- Integration with LA Frontend codebase for pattern extraction and validation
- Structured storage system for template versioning and customization
- API compatibility with existing BMAD agent orchestration system
