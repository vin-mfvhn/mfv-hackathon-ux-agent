# User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI

New UI components will leverage MoneyForward's existing design system, utilizing established patterns for dashboards, forms, and notification systems. The interface will maintain consistency with current MoneyForward applications through shared component libraries and styling frameworks.

## Modified/New Screens and Views

**New Screens**:
- Onboarding Checklist Generator (role/department input form)
- HR Dashboard (aggregate view of all new hires and their progress)
- Manager Dashboard (team-specific onboarding progress view)
- Employee Dashboard (personal onboarding checklist and progress)
- Key People Directory (suggested contacts with meeting scheduling)

## UI Consistency Requirements

- All dashboards must use MoneyForward's standard color scheme and typography
- Form inputs must follow established validation and error messaging patterns
- Progress indicators must align with existing status display conventions
- Navigation must integrate seamlessly with MoneyForward's application structure
