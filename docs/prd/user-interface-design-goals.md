# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Clean, professional interface consistent with MoneyForward design language that empowers non-technical users to create technical specifications confidently. Focus on guided workflows that reduce cognitive load while maintaining flexibility for power users.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language input for requirements with structured output
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
- **Template-First Approach**: Present template options before custom generation
- **Component Recommendation Engine**: Interactive component selection with visual previews and rationale

## Core Screens and Views
- Agent Selection Dashboard (choose MFUI UX Expert vs Product Builder)
- Component Explorer (searchable MFUI component library with usage examples)
- Template Gallery (categorized templates with preview and selection)
- Requirements Input Form (structured input for user stories and specifications)
- Generated Prototype Preview (code output with compliance validation results)
- Project Management Interface (save, version, and share generated prototypes)

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Ensure compatibility with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and MoneyForward accessibility standards for internal tool compliance.

## Branding
Consistent with MoneyForward design system including color palette, typography, and component styling. Professional, trustworthy appearance that reinforces confidence in generated outputs.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primarily desktop-focused for PdM/PO workflow but responsive design for tablet use during meetings and collaborative sessions.
