# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Reduce prototype creation time from weeks to hours (target: 90% time reduction)
- Enable 80% of prototypes to be created without designer dependency  
- Achieve 95% MoneyForward design system compliance in generated prototypes
- Accelerate overall feature development cycle time by 30%
- Transform PdM/PO workflow efficiency through systematic MFUI knowledge automation
- Create reusable template system covering 80% of common prototype use cases

## Background Context
MoneyForward Product Managers and Product Owners currently face significant bottlenecks in prototype creation due to designer dependency, component selection confusion, and fragmented knowledge of MFUI patterns. Despite having 49+ MFUI components and proven LA Frontend patterns, this knowledge isn't systematically accessible for rapid prototyping. 

This PRD addresses the critical need to systematize existing MoneyForward design knowledge through two specialized BMAD agents: the MFUI UX Expert Agent (providing deep MFUI component expertise) and the Product Builder Agent (generating template-based prototypes). The solution leverages established LA Frontend patterns rather than creating new approaches, focusing on speed-enabling iteration over perfection.
