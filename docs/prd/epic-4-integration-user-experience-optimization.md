# Epic 4: Integration & User Experience Optimization

**Epic Goal:** Complete agent integration within BMAD ecosystem, optimize user experience for PdM/PO workflows, and ensure production-ready performance and reliability.

## Story 4.1: BMAD System Integration & Agent Orchestration
As a **user**,
I want **seamless access to both agents through unified BMAD interface**,
so that **I can efficiently switch between component exploration and prototype generation**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Both agents are fully integrated into BMAD system with unified access interface
2. Agent orchestration enables smooth workflow transitions between MFUI UX Expert and Product Builder
3. Session management maintains context and data across agent interactions
4. Authentication and authorization integrate with existing BMAD security framework
5. Agent discovery and routing function correctly within BMAD ecosystem

## Story 4.2: Performance Optimization & Monitoring
As a **system administrator**,
I want **optimized performance with comprehensive monitoring**,
so that **agents meet response time requirements and maintain reliability**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Component recommendation performance consistently meets <2 second response requirement
2. Template generation performance consistently meets <30 second completion requirement
3. Performance monitoring tracks response times, accuracy metrics, and system health
4. Optimization techniques reduce latency and improve user experience
5. Monitoring alerts notify administrators of performance degradation or system issues

## Story 4.3: User Experience Refinement & Workflow Optimization
As a **Product Manager**,
I want **intuitive, efficient workflows optimized for non-technical users**,
so that **I can create prototypes quickly without technical barriers or confusion**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. User interface testing validates intuitive navigation and workflow efficiency
2. Workflow optimization reduces steps required for common prototype generation tasks
3. Error handling provides clear guidance for resolving issues and improving outcomes
4. User feedback integration enables continuous workflow improvement
5. Training materials and help documentation support user adoption and success

## Story 4.4: Production Deployment & Quality Assurance
As a **stakeholder**,
I want **production-ready deployment with comprehensive quality assurance**,
so that **agents reliably deliver value to PdM and PO teams**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Production deployment pipeline is implemented with automated testing and validation
2. Quality assurance testing confirms all functional and non-functional requirements are met
3. Load testing validates performance under expected usage patterns
4. Security review confirms compliance with MoneyForward internal security standards
5. User acceptance testing with PdM/PO teams validates real-world usage effectiveness
