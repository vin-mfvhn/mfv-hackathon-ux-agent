# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript  
**Frameworks**: React (frontend), Node.js (backend)  
**Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (caching)  
**Infrastructure**: AWS/Cloud hosting with Docker containers  
**External Dependencies**: MoneyForward authentication services, calendar APIs, notification services

## Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Extend existing HR database schema with new onboarding tables while maintaining referential integrity with employee records  
**API Integration Strategy**: Create RESTful APIs that integrate with existing MoneyForward microservices architecture  
**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Develop React components using MoneyForward's component library and state management patterns  
**Testing Integration Strategy**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests following existing MoneyForward testing frameworks

## Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Follow MoneyForward's established microservices architecture with separate services for checklist generation, progress tracking, and notifications  
**Naming Conventions**: Adhere to MoneyForward's camelCase JavaScript conventions and kebab-case for component files  
**Coding Standards**: Follow existing ESLint and Prettier configurations with TypeScript strict mode  
**Documentation Standards**: Use JSDoc for code documentation and maintain API documentation using OpenAPI specifications

## Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Integrate with existing CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and MoneyForward's deployment tools  
**Deployment Strategy**: Blue-green deployment approach aligned with MoneyForward's release management process  
**Monitoring and Logging**: Utilize existing monitoring stack (DataDog/New Relic) with structured logging for onboarding events  
**Configuration Management**: Use MoneyForward's existing configuration management system for environment-specific settings

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: Database performance impact from new tables, potential API rate limits from external calendar services  
**Integration Risks**: Dependency on multiple external systems (HR, calendar, notifications) creates failure points  
**Deployment Risks**: New microservices may impact existing MoneyForward infrastructure. **Business Continuity Risk**: Disrupting existing 18-step workflow could impact 25+ employees currently in pipeline (Sept-Oct 2025 cohort)  
**Mitigation Strategies**: Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies, use database connection pooling, establish rollback procedures for each deployment phase. **Phase rollout starting with new cohorts while maintaining parallel manual system for current pipeline**
