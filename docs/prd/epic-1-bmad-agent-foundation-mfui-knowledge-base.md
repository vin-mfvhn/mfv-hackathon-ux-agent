# Epic 1: BMAD Agent Foundation & MFUI Knowledge Base

**Epic Goal:** Establish solid technical foundation by setting up BMAD-compatible project structure, implementing comprehensive MFUI knowledge base, and creating the core data models that will power both specialized agents.

## Story 1.1: BMAD Project Setup & Infrastructure
As a **developer**,
I want **project infrastructure configured within BMAD system**,
so that **both agents can operate seamlessly within existing architecture**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Project structure follows established BMAD agent organization patterns
2. Integration points with BMAD agent orchestration are implemented and tested
3. Development, testing, and deployment pipelines are configured
4. Base agent framework classes are implemented and functional
5. Health check endpoints confirm agents are discoverable within BMAD system

## Story 1.2: MFUI Component Knowledge Base Creation
As a **system**,
I want **comprehensive structured data about all MFUI components**,
so that **agents can provide accurate recommendations and generate compliant code**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. All 49+ MFUI components are catalogued with metadata, props, usage guidelines
2. Component data includes design tokens, accessibility features, and interaction patterns  
3. Knowledge base is stored in queryable format optimized for agent access
4. Component relationships and compatibility rules are documented
5. Validation system confirms knowledge base completeness and accuracy

## Story 1.3: LA Frontend Pattern Analysis & Extraction
As a **MFUI UX Expert Agent**,
I want **proven usage patterns from LA Frontend codebase**,
so that **recommendations reflect real-world successful implementations**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. LA Frontend codebase is analyzed to identify recurring MFUI component usage patterns
2. Pattern data includes context, component combinations, and implementation approaches
3. Success metrics and usage frequency are captured for each identified pattern
4. Pattern library is structured for efficient agent queries and recommendations
5. Update mechanism ensures patterns stay current with LA Frontend evolution

## Story 1.4: Design System Compliance Validation Engine
As a **system**,
I want **automated validation against MoneyForward design system standards**,
so that **generated prototypes maintain brand and usability consistency**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Validation rules are implemented for design tokens, component usage, and accessibility
2. Compliance scoring system provides detailed feedback on generated prototypes
3. Validation engine integrates with both agents for real-time feedback
4. Error messages provide specific guidance for resolving compliance issues
5. Validation performance meets <2 second response time requirement
