**Epic Goal:** Create intelligent component recommendation system that guides PdMs and POs in selecting appropriate MFUI components based on requirements, providing rationale and ensuring design system compliance.

## Story 2.1: Component Recommendation Engine Core Logic
As a **Product Manager**,
I want **intelligent component recommendations based on my requirements**,
so that **I can confidently select appropriate MFUI components without design expertise**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Natural language requirement processing identifies UI patterns and component needs
2. Recommendation algorithm considers component capabilities, design patterns, and use case fit
3. Multiple recommendations are provided with confidence scores and rationale
4. Component alternatives are suggested with trade-offs and selection guidance
5. Recommendations meet <2 second response time requirement

## Story 2.2: Interactive Component Explorer Interface  
As a **Product Manager**,
I want **searchable component library with usage examples and previews**,
so that **I can explore MFUI options and understand implementation possibilities**.

2. Compliance scoring explains specific areas meeting or failing MoneyForward standards
3. Improvement suggestions offer actionable guidance for resolving compliance issues
4. Historical compliance tracking shows improvement over time
5. Validation integrates seamlessly into component recommendation workflow

## Story 2.4: Component Selection Documentation & Export
As a **Product Manager**,
I want **structured documentation of my component selections and rationale**,
so that **developers and stakeholders understand implementation requirements**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Component selection sessions are automatically documented with decisions and rationale
2. Export functionality generates structured specifications for development handoff
3. Documentation includes component hierarchy, interaction flows, and compliance status
4. Sharing functionality enables collaboration with development teams
