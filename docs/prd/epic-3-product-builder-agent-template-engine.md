# Epic 3: Product Builder Agent & Template Engine

**Epic Goal:** Implement template-based prototype generation system that converts requirements into structured specifications using proven LA Frontend patterns and MFUI components.

## Story 3.1: Template Pattern Library Foundation
As a **Product Builder Agent**,
I want **structured template library with categorized patterns from LA Frontend**,
so that **I can generate consistent prototypes matching proven implementation approaches**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Five core template categories are implemented: List Page, CRUD Form, DataGrid Table, SidePane, Common Component Usage
2. Each template includes component structure, interaction patterns, and MFUI component specifications
3. Template metadata includes use case descriptions, complexity ratings, and customization options
4. Template validation ensures all patterns comply with design system standards
5. Template versioning system supports updates and customization tracking

## Story 3.2: Requirements-to-Specification Translation Engine
As a **Product Manager**,
I want **automatic conversion of user stories into technical specifications**,
so that **I can bridge business requirements with implementation details efficiently**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Natural language processing extracts key entities, actions, and UI requirements from user stories
2. Requirement analysis maps business needs to appropriate template categories and components
3. Specification generation creates structured output with component hierarchy and interaction flows
4. Translation accuracy is validated against template patterns and design system compliance
5. Generated specifications include acceptance criteria mapped to technical implementation

## Story 3.3: Template Customization & Generation Engine
As a **Product Owner**,
I want **customizable template generation with specific requirement integration**,
so that **generated prototypes match my exact specifications while maintaining proven patterns**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Template customization interface allows modification of component selections and layouts
2. Dynamic generation engine combines template patterns with specific requirements
3. Customization validation ensures changes maintain design system compliance
4. Generation output includes complete component specifications and implementation guidance
5. Template generation completes within 30 second performance requirement

## Story 3.4: Prototype Specification Export & Integration
As a **Product Manager**,
I want **structured export of generated prototype specifications**,
so that **development teams have clear implementation guidance and requirements**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Export functionality generates comprehensive specification documents with component details
2. Multiple export formats support different development workflow integration needs
3. Specification includes component hierarchy, props, styling, and interaction requirements
4. Integration metadata enables seamless handoff to development teams
5. Export validation confirms specification completeness and technical accuracy
