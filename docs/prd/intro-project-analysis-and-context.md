# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis combined with comprehensive brainstorming session results

**Current Project State**: MoneyForward hackathon project developing a Smart Onboarding Assistant - an AI-powered tool for creating personalized onboarding checklists, tracking probation goals, managing tasks and readings, facilitating access provisioning, and connecting new hires with key people. **Analysis of existing onboarding data reveals a structured 18-checkpoint process across 4 timeframes (Day 1, First 5 Days, 2 Weeks, 1-2 Months) currently managed manually for 25+ employees in the Sept-Oct 2025 cohort.** The project aims to solve visibility gaps between new hires, HR, and managers during onboarding.

**Impact Assessment**:
- ✓ Major Impact (architectural changes required for multi-stakeholder system)

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:

- Eliminate visibility gaps between new hires and HR/managers on onboarding completion status
- Generate personalized onboarding checklists in <5 seconds based on MoneyForward's existing 18-step framework plus role-specific additions
- Provide real-time completion tracking with color-coded status across stakeholder views for the 4-tier timeline (Day 1, First 5 Days, 2 Weeks, 1-2 Months)
- Automate department manager assignments (Charlie→HRS, Dave→AA, James→Tech Director Office, etc.) and key people matching
- Streamline document assignment with read-confirmation and progress tracking integrated with MFJ program workflows
- **Support existing MoneyForward role structure (Engineers Grade 3-5, Information Security Managers, Senior Accelerators) across 12+ departments**

**Background Context**: Current onboarding processes suffer from scattered information across multiple systems, manual tracking processes, lack of centralized progress dashboards, and unclear completion criteria. This creates frustration for new hires, inefficiencies for HR, and blind spots for managers. The Smart Onboarding Assistant addresses these pain points through AI-driven personalization and real-time visibility.
