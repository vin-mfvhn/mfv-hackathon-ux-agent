# AI Onboarding Tool

A prototype application that demonstrates how AI-powered personalization can transform employee onboarding from generic checklists to intelligent, tailored experiences.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This hackathon prototype showcases the potential of AI in revolutionizing HR onboarding processes. Built using the MoneyForward MFUI component library and React, it demonstrates:

- **Generic vs AI-Personalized Onboarding**: Clear before/after comparison showing AI value proposition
- **Dual-Dashboard Interface**: Separate optimized experiences for HR managers and new employees
- **Mock AI Personalization Engine**: Rule-based system that generates customized content based on department and role
- **Real CSV Data Integration**: Uses actual MoneyForward onboarding data structure for realistic demonstration

## ✨ Key Features

### For HR Managers:
- **Intelligent Checklist Generation**: AI analyzes department, role, and experience to create personalized onboarding tasks
- **Time-Saving Automation**: Reduces HR preparation time from 4-5 hours to 45-60 minutes
- **Smart Resource Matching**: Automatically suggests relevant contacts, resources, and applications
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into new hire onboarding completion

### For New Employees:
- **Personalized Welcome Experience**: Tailored messaging based on role and department context
- **Role-Specific Guidance**: Customized checklists that prioritize relevant tasks
- **Department Resource Integration**: Relevant documentation, tools, and contact information
- **Interactive Progress Tracking**: Visual completion status with celebration milestones

## 🚀 Demo Scenarios

## 📊 AI Personalization Logic

The mock AI engine personalizes onboarding based on:

- **Department Context**: QA, AA, SCI, HRS specific requirements
- **Role Level**: Engineer, Senior, Manager, Principal responsibilities  
- **Experience Background**: Previous experience and personality traits
- **Resource Matching**: Relevant tools, applications, and contacts
- **Time Optimization**: Intelligent task prioritization and time estimates

## 🎥 Demo Flow

1. **Role Selection**: Choose between HR Manager or Employee perspective
2. **HR Dashboard**: 
   - Input new hire information
   - AI generates personalized checklist
   - Review and customize before sending
3. **Employee Dashboard**:
   - Personalized welcome experience
   - Interactive checklist with progress tracking
   - Department-specific resources and contacts
4. **Completion**: Celebration milestone when onboarding is complete
