## Slide 1: Executive Summary
**BMAD Agent Development: Accelerating Product Manager Prototype Creation**

**The Challenge:** Product Managers wait weeks for simple UI prototypes due to designer dependency bottlenecks

**The Solution:** Two specialized AI agents that systematize MoneyForward's design knowledge
- **MFUI UX Expert Agent:** Deep component expertise and selection guidance
- **Product Builder Agent:** Template-based prototype generation from requirements

**The Impact:** Transform prototype creation from weeks to hours (90% time reduction)

**Investment:** 6-8 weeks development, targeting PdMs and POs at MoneyForward

---

## Slide 2: Problem Analysis - Current State Pain Points
**Designer Dependency Bottleneck**
- PdMs cannot create UI prototypes without designer availability
- Critical path bottleneck slowing validation cycles
- Designer time consumed on early-stage work rather than refined designs

**Component Selection Confusion**
- PdMs know WHAT they want but struggle with HOW to structure using available MFUI components
- 49+ MFUI components available but knowledge is fragmented
- Non-technical stakeholders struggle with appropriate template and pattern choices

**Knowledge Fragmentation**
- MFUI component expertise exists but isn't systematically accessible
- LA Frontend patterns proven but not catalogued for reuse
- Inconsistent outputs due to ad-hoc approaches

**Business Impact**
- Weeks required for simple prototype creation instead of hours
- Reduced innovation speed as ideas stall waiting for technical implementation
- Resource inefficiency and inconsistent design system compliance
