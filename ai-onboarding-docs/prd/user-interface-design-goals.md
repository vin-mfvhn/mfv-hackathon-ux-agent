# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create an intuitive, welcoming experience that clearly demonstrates the transformation from generic onboarding to intelligent, personalized guidance. The interface should feel modern and professional while making the AI value proposition immediately obvious through side-by-side comparisons.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Dual-Zone Navigation:** Clear separation between HR Manager workspace and Employee onboarding experience
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show relevant information at the right time based on role and department selection
- **Instant Feedback:** Immediate visual updates when switching between personalization scenarios
- **Demo-Driven Flow:** Optimized for presentation with clear navigation between key demonstration points

## Core Screens and Views
- **Landing/Selection Screen:** Department and role picker that drives personalization
- **HR Manager Dashboard:** Input interface for new hire information and generated checklist review
- **Employee Onboarding View:** Personalized welcome screen with customized checklists and resources
- **Before/After Comparison:** Split-screen showing generic vs AI-personalized approaches
- **Demo Navigation Hub:** Easy switching between different role scenarios for presentation

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Ensure proper color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and alt text for all images and interactive elements.

## Branding
Clean, professional design with subtle AI-themed visual cues (gradients, smart icons) that convey intelligence and personalization without being overly futuristic. Use calming colors that reduce onboarding anxiety.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary focus on desktop for HR manager dashboard with mobile-responsive design ensuring new employee experience works seamlessly on all devices.
