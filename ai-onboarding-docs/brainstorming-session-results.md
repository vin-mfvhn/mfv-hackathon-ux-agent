## Technique Sessions

### Question Storming - YOLO Mode (Accelerated)

**Description:** Rapid-fire question generation to unlock innovative approaches for hackathon demo.

**Key Questions Generated:**

1. How can we make onboarding feel magical with minimal complexity?
2. What's the absolute minimum viable demo that shows AI value?
3. How do we simulate smart personalization without complex ML?
4. What would make judges go "wow" in 3 minutes?
5. How can HR managers input new hire info in under 30 seconds?
6. What if the AI could suggest the perfect buddy based on personality/role match?
7. How do we show before/after impact of AI personalization?
8. What's the simplest way to demonstrate ROI to stakeholders?
9. How can new hires feel welcomed before their first day?
10. What would eliminate the most common onboarding pain points?
