# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Reduce HR onboarding preparation time by 80% (from 4-5 hours to 45-60 minutes per new hire)
- Achieve 95%+ new hire satisfaction scores on onboarding experience through AI personalization
- Create compelling hackathon demo showcasing AI value proposition in HR transformation
- Transform generic onboarding into intelligent, personalized experiences using AI
- Demonstrate clear ROI through time savings and efficiency improvements

## Background Context
Current onboarding processes suffer from critical pain points including generic one-size-fits-all approaches, excessive manual HR overhead (3-5 hours per hire), and inconsistent personalization that delays time-to-productivity by 23%. With remote and hybrid work increasing complexity, organizations need intelligent solutions that deliver personalized experiences at scale.

The AI Onboarding Tool prototype demonstrates how AI could analyze department and role data to generate personalized onboarding experiences through a dual-dashboard interface serving both HR managers and new employees, using pre-built mock data to showcase intelligent personalization without backend complexity.
